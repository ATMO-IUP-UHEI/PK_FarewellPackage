Program to convert ERA5 spherical data on levante to files usable by Flexextract and FLEXPART. It replaces the download of ERA5 data performed with flex_extract via the command get_mars_data. THe output data needs to be preprocessed with the prepare_flexpart script of felx_extract.

The following scripts are part of the program:
convert_era5_dkrz_ml_v6.py
- Main script to convert data for individual parameters or file format needed by flex_extract (combine the daily data for necessary parameters), based on config file
Start_ConvertEra5.sh
- start main script with sbatch Start_ConvertEra5.sh
prepare_flexpart.sh
- start all steps to prepare data from FLEXPART run with sbatch prepare_flexpart.sh, need flex_extract installation
    (includes Start_ConvertEra5.sh, start_flex_extract_prepareflexpart.sh, Bulkstart_prepare_EA_files.sh)
sh_merge.sh
- merges the individual files for each day and parameter together in 3-day files with all parameters of one type 
convert_ANOG__ML.py
- the data for the ANOG__ML file type of flex_extract is converted parallel in the background jobs. This script is used for the background jobs
ConvertANOG__ML.sh
- start the background jobs
adjust_fc_file.sh
- adjust times in forecast fields for first day of the month (due to inconsistencies in file format)
check_status.sh
- check that all background jobs are completed before merging ANOG__ML or FCOG_acc_SL files
prepare_EA_files.sh
- adapt order of parameters in EA files produced with start_flex_extract_prepareflexpart.sh for use with FLEXPART
- for single file or all files in a subdirectory
Bulkstart_prepare_EA_files.sh
- start prepare_EA_files.sh skript for all files in a day/month/year simultaneously

The following things have to be adapted before using the scripts:
config/config_test.yaml
- set time period, output path, resolution, area, control_outpath if use for flepxart
- set individual parameters/ flexpart files that should be downloaded
- for use with prepare_flexpart.sh, adapt CONTROL dummy 
Start_ConvertEra5.sh:
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
- adapt config filepath and config file content
- adapt conda environment
prepare_flexpart.sh:
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
- adapt conda environment
- adapt listed paths and variables
- adapt flex_extract source path
- adapt convertERA5 source path
sh_merge.sh:
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
ConvertANOG__ML.sh
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
- adapt conda environment
adjust_fc_file.sh
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
check_status.sh!!!
- adapt userID
prepare_EA_files.sh:
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
Bulkstart_prepare_EA_files.sh
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
