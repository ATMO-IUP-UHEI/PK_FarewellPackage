Program to convert ERA5 spherical data on levante to files usable by Flexextract and FLEXPART. It replaces the download of ERA5 data performed with flex_extract via the command get_mars_data. THe output data needs to be preprocessed with the prepare_flexpart script of felx_extract.

The following scripts are part of the program:
convert_era5_dkrz_ml_v5.py
- Main script to convert data for each day ad parameter and to combine the daily data in the file format needed by flex_extract
Start_ConvertEra5.sh
- start main script with sbatch Start_ConvertEra5.sh
sh_merge.sh
- merges the individual files for each day and parameter together in 3-day files with all parameters of one type 
convert_ANOG__ML.py
- the data for the ANOG__ML file type of flex_extract is converted parallel in the background jobs. This script is used for the background jobs
ConvertANOG__ML.sh
- start the background jobs
check_status.sh
- check that all background jobs are completed before merging ANOG__ML files

The following things have to be adapted before using the scripts:
Start_ConvertEra5.sh:
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
- adapt conda environment
sh_merge.sh:
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
ConvertANOG__ML.sh
- adapt error and ouput filepath for the slurm jobs
- adapt conda environment
check_status.sh!!!
-adapt userID
